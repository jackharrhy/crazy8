# crazy8

it is a working, [juice-less](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_feel) basic version of crazy eights

the idea was to build something basic to figure out the technical stack ahead of time / the structure for [whackjack](https://github.com/jackharrhy/whackjack)

this code is a descendant from [jahns](https://github.com/jackharrhy/jahns), which is a descendant from [tictac](https://github.com/jackharrhy/tictac)

## running

- `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- start with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
